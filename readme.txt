Ch 8 Lesson 
Django for Beginners by William S. Vincent

-Created a new Newspaper app with a custom user model using AbstractUser
 
-Always use a custom user model for all new Django projects because changing the default user model in the future is more compclicated than using a custom user model from the beginning.

-Wait until after weâ€™ve created our new custom user model before running migrate to configure our database.

-superuser password is Password_01

-Updated UserCreationForm and UserChangeForm to use customUser model instead of default.
-Update admin.py to extend the existing UserAdmin class to use our new CustomUser model
# users/admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin
from .forms import CustomUserCreationForm, CustomUserChangeForm
from .models import CustomUser

class CustomUserAdmin(UserAdmin):
	add_form = CustomUserCreationForm

admin.site.register(CustomUser, CustomUserAdmin)
